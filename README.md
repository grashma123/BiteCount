### Project Description
The Hostel Mess Food Count System is a web-based platform that allows students to book or cancel meals in advance, helping mess admins optimize food preparation and reduce waste. It features real-time meal tracking, automated reports, and notifications, ensuring efficient and cost-effective hostel mess management.

### The Problem statement
Hostel messes often face challenges in managing food consumption, leading to excessive food wastage, inaccurate meal planning, and inefficiencies in inventory management. Without a proper system, mess staff struggle to estimate the exact number of meals required, while students lack a convenient way to book or cancel their meals in advance. This results in operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and resource mismanagement. There is a need for an automated, real-time food count system that enables students to register their meals and helps mess administrators optimize food preparation, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency.
